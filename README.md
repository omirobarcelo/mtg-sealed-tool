# MTG Sealed Tool
**STOPPED**  

Using the SDK and packages to interact with Scryfall and MTG API are generally hard to configure with Svelte.  

I found one package that worked well, as far as I know, and lo and behold, Scryfall does not have the functionality I want --getting all the cards in a set.

For MTG API there's only one (well, two, one for JS and one for TS), and it doesn't work. Or I don't want to spend the time to make it work.

I could just use `fetch` and query the APIs directly, but at this point, I'm not motivated to continue; what I was going to gain with this project is too little for what it's gonna take me.
